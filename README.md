## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Paul Jacotin

I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in building robust, scalable web applications. I specialize in back-end development, particularly with the Symfony framework, which I find ideal for complex projects requiring a solid structure. I'm also skilled in database management and have experience integrating secure payment solutions.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- A ticket reservation system for the Olympics, using Symfony for the backend. This project includes advanced user management, secure authentication, and payment processing with Stripe Checkout.
- An API built with Symfony to streamline data handling for front-end clients, where I'm currently using SvelteKit to retrieve and display data dynamically.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Best practices for API development and integration, focusing on data handling and security.
- Improved database structuring and optimization with MariaDB on Heroku.
- Advanced use of Agile Scrum methodologies with Trello to enhance project management efficiency.
